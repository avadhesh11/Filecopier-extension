# Filecopier-extension
tbh i made it for my own use but then realized nothing like it exists before so pushed it here, hehe.

How to use-
So you can add any files(like .txt,.py,.cpp,.html.css,.js.....etc) here which will be stored in local storge of browser and the content will be the text of that file so when you click copy button it copies all the content of that file on clipboard. It can be a useful tool for programmer doinng CP and other stuff who requires some piece of code again and again and yaa my extension too have a search bar for easy access. So yaa that's it.
